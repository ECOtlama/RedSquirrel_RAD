Lisa has archived a full copy of the data (straight from the sequencing center) in her long term cluster storage. 
Working directory for this project is /project/uma_lisa_komoroske/Morelli_RAD/

We have TWO lanes of data for this project. They were separated into ./STACKS_L7/00_RAW_data and ./STACKS_L8/00_RAW_data and demultiplexed according to steps 1-3 of the STACKS pipeline (https://hackmd.io/YdkcvtksQNijTDcA1qvd5A?view#Stacks-Pipeline---Streamlined)

The demultiplexed reads were then concatenated for each individual. Concatenated fastq files are located in ./download/fastq

Data for AGS samples are stored in ./download/fastq/03_clone_filter_out_arctic_squirrel/
